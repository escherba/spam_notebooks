# Some R and Python notebooks for spam analysis

## Installing

To get a working LaTeX installation on Mac, it is sufficient to
download BasicTeX:
http://www.tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html

On Mavericks you will also need to:
ln -s /Library/TeX/Distributions/Programs/texbin /usr/texbin

Don't forget to add /usr/texbin to your path to make PDF exporting work.

## Viewing

You can view some of these notebooks through the NBViewer or you can download
pdfs from the results/ directory.
